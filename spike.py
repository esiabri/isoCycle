# Here we generate firing rate vector for a vector of spike times that are passed to the function
# inputs:
# 1 - spikeTimes: the vector of spike times, the times should be in seconds
# 2 - startTime: the start of the signal (if not provided, then the smallest spike time is considered as the signal start)
# 3 - endTime: the end of the signal (if not provided, then the largest spike time is consdiered as the sinal end)

# optional inputs:
# dt: the temporal resolution of the firing rate vector to be generated, the default value is 1 ms
# windowSize: the window size for counting the spikes, the default value is 50 ms
# slidingWindow: (default True) using sliding windows for calculating the firing rate, if slideingWindow is set
# to false then the dt (temporal resolution) is set to be equall to the windowsize regardless of the value that
# is passed to the function

# outputs:
# 1- timePoints: the vector of time points regarding the output firing rate vector
# 2- FR: the vector of firing rate
