<!-- # Running Example Notebook

You can then import isoCycle and run the example Notebook: 
<!-- [MOVE THE EXAMPLE DOC TO ITS OWN FOLDER WITH A LINK HERE----TO RUN THE NOTEBOOK ON THE SAME ENV IT NEEDS EXTRA STEPS (what if the env name is known?, running the notebook with a predefined kernel, but it needs to have the additional code for adding the kernel to the jupyter kernel list----] -->
```buildoutcfg
from isoCycle import decoder
decoder.run_example()

open a terminal on your computer and execute the following commands:
  <br>(replace myenv with the name of your environment)
```buildoutcfg
conda activate myenv
```
  
```buildoutcfg
python
```
```buildoutcfg
from isoCycle import decoder
decoder.run_example() -->
```
